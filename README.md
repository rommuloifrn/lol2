How much good you are at not playing lol.

This project is basically a time counter for the time since you last played League of Legends. It is meant to have two stages:

- 1: A time-since-last-match viewer, where you put the summoner id and get the time
- 2: A Riot API integrated app where you can build an account and get elos based on the time since your last match.
